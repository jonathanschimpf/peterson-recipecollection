# 🥘 Peterson Recipe Collection 🥘

A nostalgic archive of handwritten and printed recipes, continuously collected and preserved by the Peterson family since the 1980s. Digitized by scanning & OCR-GPT-transcribed in 2024–2025. Built with SvelteKit to preserve the charm of the originals in a clean, modern interface.

Carefully organized for fast browsing, smooth zooming, and reading verbatim text — this project blends nostalgia with responsive design to honor decades of meals and memories.

The 'About' section will be updated to include some backstory soon.
