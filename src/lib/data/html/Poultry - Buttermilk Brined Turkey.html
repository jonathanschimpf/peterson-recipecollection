<p>1½ cups turkey brine •  4 qt. buttermilk •  1 fresh turkey, 16-18 lbs., heart, neck and gizzard removed (reserved, if desired) •  4 Tbs. (½ stick) butter, at room temperature</p>
<p>In saucepan, bring turkey brine and 1 qt. water to boil. Simmer over medium-low heat, stirring until brine dissolves, 5-10 minutes.
Let cool to room temperature. In large pot, combine brine mixture and buttermilk.</p>
<p>Rinse turkey with cold water; place in large brining bag. Carefully pour in brine; seal bag.
Place in large pot; refrigerate 24-36 hours.</p>
<p>Remove turkey from brine. Rinse turkey with cold water; pat dry. Trim off excess fat. Place turkey, breast side up, on rack in large roasting pan. Rub skin with butter. Truss as desired.
Let stand at room temperature 1 hour.</p>
<p>Position rack in lower third of oven; preheat to 400°F. Roast turkey 30 minutes. Reduce heat to 325°F; continue roasting, basting every 30 minutes with pan juices. If breast cooks too quickly, tent with foil. After 2 hours total roasting time, begin testing for doneness with instant-read thermometer; breast should register 165°F and thigh, 175°F. Total roasting time should be 3-4 hours.</p>
<p>Transfer turkey to carving board; tent with foil. Let rest 20-30 minutes before carving.</p>
