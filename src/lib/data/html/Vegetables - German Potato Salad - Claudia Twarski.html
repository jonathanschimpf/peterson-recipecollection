German Potato Salad</p>
<p>5# Potatoes
1# Bacon
1 large onion diced
1/4 cup flour
1/3 cup lemon juice less 1 1/2 tbls
1/3 cup vinegar plus 1 1/2 tbls.
1/3 cup dark brown sugar
1/3 cup white sugar
1 1/3 cup hot water from tap</p>
<p>Cook potatoes in skins until tender (be careful not to overcook, if you overcook, be sure potatoes are cold before you cut them). Cool in ice cold water. Peel and cut in small pieces. Put in a large bowl.</p>
<p>Cut bacon into small pieces and brown over medium heat until bacon is crisp. Remove bacon from pan with slotted spoon and sprinkle crisp bacon bits over cut up potatoes.</p>
<p>Cook diced onion in bacon grease until translucent using a low heat. When onions translucent, remove from bacon grease with slotted spoon and sprinkle onion pieces over cut-up potatoes. Lightly pepper potatoes with freshly ground pepper and lightly toss potatoes with bacon and onion to mix. Do not over mix as potatoes may break up too much or become mushy.</p>
<p>Remove all but 1/4 cup of grease from pan to save for sauerkraut or toss out. Increase heat under bacon grease and add flour to grease and mix well with slotted spoon until blended. Slowly and carefully (so you wonâ€™t get splashed with grease) add vinegar and lemon juice to grease and blend with slotted spoon. Add sugars to gravy mixture, and blend with slotted spoon. Carefully add hot water to mixture and quickly blend with slotted spoon.</p>
<p>Pour gravy mixture over potatoes and gingerly mix (not to mush potatoes) and serve warm.</p>
