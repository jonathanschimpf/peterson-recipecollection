<p><b>(7 Cups)</b></p>
<p>This soup is like a Gazpacho; you can add any number of different garnishes to the finished soup when serving.</p>
<p>2 pounds cucumbers (about 4 medium), peeled and seeded •  2 cloves garlic •  ½ small onion •  3 cups chicken broth •  1 cup sour cream •  3 tablespoons white wine vinegar •  1 teaspoon salt, or to taste •  Dash of Tabasco or cayenne pepper</p>
<p>Garnishes:
1 tomato, chopped •  1 small bunch scallions, trimmed and sliced thin •  ¼ cup chopped parsley •  ¼ cup toasted sliced almonds</p>
<p>Using a food processor and working in two or three batches, process the cucumbers, garlic, onion, and 1 cup of the chicken broth, until you have a purée. Pour all of the cucumber mixture into a large mixing bowl and add the remaining broth, sour cream, vinegar, salt, and Tabasco or cayenne and whisk together until thoroughly blended and smooth. Taste and correct seasonings. Chill in the refrigerator for 4 to 6 hours. Stir well before serving. Pass the garnishes of tomato, scallion, parsley, and almonds in separate bowls or spoon some of each into the soup bowl before serving.</p>
