1 cup plus 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour •  1 teaspoon baking powder •  ¾ cup pitted dates •  ¼ cups boiling water •  1 teaspoon baking soda •  ¼ cup unsalted butter, softened •  ¼ cup granulated sugar •  1 large egg, lightly beaten •  1 teaspoon vanilla</p>
<p><b>Toffee Sauce</b>:
½ cup unsalted butter •  ½ cup heavy cream •  1 cup packed light brown sugar •  1 cup heavy cream, whipped</p><br>
