<p>2 packages - dry yeast (dissolved in 1 cup of lukewarm water) •  3 cups - unbleached flour •  ¼ cup - olive oil •  1 teaspoon - sugar •  1 teaspoon - salt •  3 tablespoons - tomato paste •  1 medium yellow onion - peeled and chopped (can also substitute green spring onions) •  1 clove - garlic (crushed) •  Fresh cracked pepper</p><br>
<br>
<p>1 - Place the water and yeast in a mixing bowl. Add half the flour, ¼ cup of olive oil, sugar, and salt, and mix with an electric mixer until smooth. Add the remaining flour and blend by hand.</p>
<p>2 - Place the dough on a floured board and knead for 5 minutes (this can also be done in an electric mixer with a hook rather than by hand). Place the dough in a large, oiled bowl so it doesn't stick, and cover the dough with plastic wrap. Allow the dough to rise for about 1 hour, or until doubled in bulk.</p>
<p>3 - When it is doubled, punch the dough down, and knead it for 1-2 minutes. Roll the dough out to fit a greased 9 x 13-inch shallow pan, and place the dough in the pan.</p>
<p>4 - Let the dough rise until not quite doubled in bulk, and then punch holes all over it using a fork. Brush the top of the dough with some olive oil and then the tomato paste.</p>
<p>5 - Mix together the onion and garlic and sprinkle over the top of the dough. Sprinkle with the pepper.</p>
<p>6 - Preheat the oven and bake at 375°F for about 25 minutes, or until lightly browned. </p>
<p>Yummm!!!</p>
