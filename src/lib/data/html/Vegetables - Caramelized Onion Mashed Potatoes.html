<p>4 Tbs. unsalted butter •  2 Tbs. olive oil •  2 red onions, thinly sliced •  4 lb. Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and quartered •  1½ cups half-and-half, heated •  White pepper</p>
<p>In a sauté pan over medium-high heat melt butter and olive oil. Add onions and cook until translucent. Reduce heat to low and let cook until caramelized, about ½ hour. Remove from heat.</p>
<p>Put potatoes in a large pot with enough cold water to cover. Bring to a boil. Add a pinch of salt and boil until tender when pierced with a fork, about 15 min. Drain well. Put the potatoes through a ricer or mill. Slowly add half-and-half, stirring constantly until potatoes are creamy but not soupy. Mix in caramelized onions; add salt and white pepper to taste.</p>
