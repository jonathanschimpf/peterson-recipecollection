<p>Makes 6 to 8 servings</p>
<p>3 cups milk •  1 vanilla bean •  6 large egg yolks •  1 cup sugar •  1 teaspoon brandy or kirsch •  Pinch of salt •  3 large egg whites, at room temperature •  Caramel Syrup (optional; recipe follows)</p><br>
<p>1 - In nonaluminum, 2-quart saucepan, heat milk and vanilla bean over low heat 10 minutes. Do not heat to boiling. Remove vanilla bean; wash and dry to use again, if desired.</p>
<p>2 - In 4-cup measuring cup used for milk, or in small bowl, beat egg yolks, ½ cup sugar, the brandy, and salt. Beat in a little warm milk. Beat yolk mixture back into milk in saucepan. Heat gently over low heat, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens slightly and coats a spoon—about 15 minutes. Pour custard into large shallow serving dish and set aside to cool.</p>
<p>3 - Fill large skillet halfway with water and heat to simmering. In small bowl, beat egg whites until foamy. Gradually add remaining ½ cup sugar, beating until stiff peaks form. With large spoon, scoop up egg-white meringue and shape into a large oval or "egg" with the help of another spoon or spatula. Slide meringue "egg" into simmering water. Poach "eggs," 6 at a time, for 3 minutes. Gently turn "eggs" and poach 3 minutes longer. Remove with slotted spoon to drain on paper towels.</p>
<p>4 - Arrange "eggs" on top of cooled custard in serving dish. Refrigerate until serving time.</p>
<p>5 - Before serving, prepare Caramel Syrup. Drizzle over meringue "eggs."</p>
<p>Caramel Syrup: In small saucepan, combine ½ cup sugar and 1 tablespoon water until well mixed. Cook over low heat until sugar is completely dissolved and amber in color. Do not stir the sugar as it melts but swirl the pan so it melts evenly. Cool a few minutes before using.</p>
