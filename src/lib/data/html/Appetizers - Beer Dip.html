<p>4 - packages cream cheese, softened • 
1 - bunch scallions, sliced • 
16 ounces - shredded sharp cheddar cheese • 
1 large package or 2 small packages - Hidden Valley Ranch dressing (dry mix) • 
1 - 24-ounce beer (I prefer Budweiser, but use what you like; you’ll use about ¾ of the can)</p><br/>
<p>Beat softened cream cheese and Hidden Valley Ranch dressing with a little bit of beer—just enough to blend, but not too much to avoid splatter.</p>
<p>Continue to add beer until the consistency is slightly soupy, then start folding in cheese and sliced scallions.</p>
<p>Reserve some cheese and scallion greens for garnish. Refrigerate until ready to serve.</p>
<p>Serve with pretzels!</p>
