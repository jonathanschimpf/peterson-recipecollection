<p>Summer Potato Salad
Gerry Edwards</p>
<p>2 pounds small red potatoes
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
3 tablespoons walnut oil - VEG
3 tablespoons olive oil
4 oz. feta cheese, crumbled (1 cup) or LESS
1/2 lb. young green beans, ends snapped off
8 large basil leaves
2 red peppers, roasted
5 cups salad greens* - OPTIONAL</p>
<p>Steam potatoes for 15 to 20 minutes, depending on size, until tender. In a large bowl, mix salt, vinegar, walnut oil and the olive oil. Crumble cheese into dressing.</p>
<p>A few minutes before potatoes are ready, bring a large amount of water to a boil and drop in beans for 2 minutes, or long enough to cook away their raw crunch. Peel steaming potatoes hot and cut into 1/4-inch slices; toss them in dressing. Drain the beans and toss them with the potatoes. With your hands, shred the basil leaves and add to salad. Cut the roasted peppers into strips and add to salad. Taste and adjust seasoning.</p>
<p>When ready to serve, toss in salad greens.</p>
