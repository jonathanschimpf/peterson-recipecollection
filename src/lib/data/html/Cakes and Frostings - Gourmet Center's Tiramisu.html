<p>3 - egg yolks •  2 tablespoons - powdered sugar •  8 ounces - mascarpone cheese •  6 tablespoons - strong coffee, cold •  1 tablespoon - Grand Marnier •  24 - Dutch ladyfingers •  2 tablespoons - cocoa powder</p>
<p>Beat the egg yolks and sugar together with an electric mixer until pale and thick. Add the mascarpone and beat until smooth.</p>
<p>In a shallow bowl, combine the coffee and liqueur. Dip the ladyfingers in the coffee mixture just long enough to soak up the liquid without becoming soggy.</p>
<p>Line the bottom of your serving dish with half of the soaked ladyfingers, cover with half the mascarpone mixture, and sprinkle with cocoa powder. Repeat with the remaining ladyfingers, mascarpone, and cocoa.</p>
<p>Cover and chill for two hours. Serves 4.</p>
