<p>Briefly chilling the bowl keeps the cream cold, making it easier to whip. crush the espresso beans one at a time so they don’t stick together. cookies are perfect for dipping; we used thin chocolate-covered wafer sticks.</p>
<p>1¼ cups heavy cream •  2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon sugar •  1 teaspoon instant espresso powder •  ¼ cup chocolate-covered espresso beans (about 30)</p>
<p>Whisk together cream, sugar, and espresso powder in a medium bowl until soft peaks form. refrigerate whipped cream mixture until ready to use.</p>
<p>Lightly crush espresso beans on a cutting board, 1 at a time, with the side of a large knife. just before serving, gently fold crushed espresso beans into whipped cream mixture. spoon into bowls.</p>
