<p>½ pint (300 ml) / 1¼ cups cream •  ½ pint (300 ml) / 1¼ cups milk •  3 eggs •  2 tablespoons vanilla castor sugar (or unflavoured sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla essence) •  Brown sugar</p><br>
<p>Empty cream and milk into a thick-bottomed saucepan, bringing the creamy milk not quite to the boil. lightly whisk the eggs with the sugar and vanilla. add to the warmed creamy milk mixture. make sure the cream mixture is not too hot (otherwise it will curdle). half-fill a roasting pan with boiling water to make a bain-marie and ladle the cream and egg mixture into small earthenware custard dishes. stand the puddings in the pan and cook for 2-2½ hours at 250°f/130°c/regulo ½.</p>
<p>These puddings require gentle cooking; otherwise they will curdle. test to see whether they have set by shaking gently. cool overnight. the puddings must be cold before the brûlée is added.</p>
<p>An hour before you serve the crème brûlée, sprinkle brown sugar over each one and place under the grill until the sugar melts, spreads and browns. watch over them to see the sugar does not burn.</p>
<p>Serve with langue du chat finger biscuits.</p>
