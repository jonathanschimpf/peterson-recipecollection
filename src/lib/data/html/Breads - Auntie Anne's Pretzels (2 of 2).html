<p><b>Preparation:</b></p>
<p>Sprinkle yeast on lukewarm water in mixing bowl; stir to dissolve. Add sugar, salt and stir to
dissolve; add flour and knead dough until smooth and elastic. Let rise at least ½ hour.</p>
<p>While dough is rising, prepare a baking soda water bath with 2 cups of warm water and 2 tablespoons of baking soda. Be certain to stir often.</p>
<p>After the dough has risen, pinch off bits of dough and roll into a long rope (about ½ of an inch or less thick) and shape. Dip pretzel in soda solution and place on a greased baking sheet. Allow pretzels to rise again. Bake in the oven at 450° for about 10 minutes or until golden. Brush with melted butter and enjoy!</p>
<p><b>Toppings:</b></p>
<p>After you brush with butter try sprinkling with coarse salt.</p>
<p>Or for Auntie Anne's famous cinnamon sugar, try melting a stick of butter in a shallow bowl (big enough to fit the entire pretzel) and in another shallow bowl make a mixture of cinnamon and sugar. Dip the pretzel into the butter, coating both sides generously. then dip again into the cinnamon mixture. Enjoy!</p>
